# Affectiva Beginner Practice

This project bases on Affectiva and ViewGraph. Both APIs are amazing: one is for affective computing and other is for data-collection and visualization. 

For Affectiva, it is quiet accurate and developers have a deliberate system or frame for data-collection, data-handle, and so on. 

Above all, appreciate both open resourse.
