# Affectiva Beginner Practice

This project bases on Affectiva and ViewGraph. Both APIs are amazing: one is for affective computing and other is for data-collection and visualization. 

One Documentation:
  * On the graph, green line means threshold; Blue line shows current joy value; Black line presents mean of joy.

Above all, appreciate both open resourse.
